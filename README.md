# TensorFlow-Projects
All these projects are implemented in Tensorflow Framework

## Mini Tensorflow Framework 
### Description :
    Mini tensorflow framework is created in python to understand the workflow of tensorflow. 
    In this project, i tried to replicate the tensorflow style of using Graph, operation, Variable and placeholder.
    
    ** Project 1: Linear Regression using Tensorflow **
    ** Project 2: Tensorflow Eager API which helps in creating a dynamic graph like Pytorch **
